# Compiler Autotuning through Multiple Phase Learning

In this repository, we provide our code and the data.

## Dataset

The folder `benchmarks` contains all the programs.

The folder `cbench` contains the programs of cBench.

The folder `polybench` contains the programs of PolyBench.

## Algorithm

The folder `algorithm` contains all the code we used.

`BOCA.py` is the BOCA algorithm.

`GA.py` is the GA algorithm.

`RIO.py` is the Random Iteration Optimization algorithm.

`TPE.py` is the TPE algorithm.

`COBYAN.py` is the COBYAN algorithm

`OpenTuner.py` is the OpenTuner algorithm

`CompTuner.py` is our proposed  **CompTuner** algorithm.

We add a README file in the `algorithm` folder to help you understand and run the programs.

## Result

The folder `results` contains all the results of (speedup and time consumption for seven techniques).

We add a README file in the `result` folder to help you understand the source data and result data for our expriments.


## Note

Different versions of compilers use different compilation commands, so please pay attention to modify the relevant statements.
